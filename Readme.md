There are two modes, Disallowed Application and Allowed Application, but you can not specify them at the same time.
Because of this you will have to choose whether you want to run in either mode.
The default is **Disallowed Application** selected.

* Disallowed Application
  * Select the application you want to exclude from VPN service.
    The selected application will no longer go through VPN service and behave the same as if you do not use VPN.

* Allowed Application
  * Select the application for which you want to perform VPN service.
    The selected application will now go through VPN service.
    Applications that are not selected behave the same as when not using VPN.
    In addition, if none of them are selected, communication of all applications will go through VPN.

* Clear all selection
  * Clear all selections of Allowed / Disallowed application list.
